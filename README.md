# My tinder App

Link: <a href='google.com'>Tinder by Armando Rivas</a>

This project was made with React.js, using the typescript template. For the frontend I used Material UI for the styles, components and Icons. For the backend we used MongoDB and express, where the back end was deployed in heroku, while the front end was deployed in Firebase.

ðŸ¤“I had a lot of fun making this simple app to demonstrate my acquired knowledge in these technologies.ðŸ¦¾
